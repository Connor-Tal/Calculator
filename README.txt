Hi, this is a data management tool 

There is a general use calculator
There is alsa a calculator intrest and income
Expect more to be added soon!
The calculator is not perfect, but it is working
I plan to add multi step equation support in the future
(calculator(general).py) and (calculator(info).py)

There is also a random number generator
You can also generate a random string of letters
With more to be added soon
(random.py)

Also to test how long something takes to appear in a bunch or random numbers/strings of letters
This records the trials and the amount of seconds it takes
WARNING: This prosses takes a lot of memory and time!
